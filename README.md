# externalJS
External Adcode for AMP iframe to display ads in sticky sidebar when amp-sticky already exists. This hack is used to implement sticky sidebar for www.knowseeker.com and other amp websites
It is still in development and contribution from the public is welcome.
Implementing sticky amp in the sidebar has been a serious challenge for most amp developers. There are quite some solutions out there, even on github but they are not clear enough for most people to understand, including me.
So, in this project, I plan to make this solution easily available to everyone who needs it.
